# Simple Ethereum Dapp

It showcases how to access an injected Ethereum provider, in this case `window.web3`, as it was pre-EIP-1102, a.k.a. from the start.

The GUI displays:

* whether you are connected to Ethereum
* the balances of your accounts, if you have any
* the balance of any address you paste in the input box

After cloning it, to run this program, you need to:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) in your preferred browser.
